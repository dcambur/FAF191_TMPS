# Design Patterns


## Author: Cambur Dumitru

----

## Objectives:

* Get familiar with the DPs;
* Choose a specific domain;
* Implement at least 3 creational and structural DPs;


## Used Design Patterns: 

* Abstract Factory
* Prototype
* Builder


## Implementation

Let's build a toy factory! 
Abstract Factory is used to work with different toy factories
Builder is used to make MVP and Full product versions by parts
Prototype is used for mass-producing (if implementing this will ever be needed)

Facade is used to hide some initialization process 
from the client
Decorator is used to create the logging logic
Proxy is needed to combine logging logic with the product creation

### Snippets
#### Decorator
```
class ProductLogger:
    toys_created = 0

    def __init__(self, director):
        self.product = director.builder.product

    def switch(self, new_director):
        self.product = new_director.builder.product

    def log(self, send_from, send_to):
        self.toys_created += 1

        return {"from": send_from,
                "to": send_to,
                "msg": f"{self.product.factory_name}: the {self.product.type} "
                       f"toy was created at {datetime.datetime.now()} ",
                "toys_created": self.toys_created,
                "toys_parts": f"{self.product.parts}"}

```

#### Proxy
```
class ClientProxy:
    def __init__(self, real_client):
        self.real_client = real_client
        self.logger = None

    def __logger_init(self, director):
        if not self.logger:
            self.logger = ProductLogger(director)
        else:
            self.logger.switch(director)

    def create_product(self, director, mvp=False):
        self.__logger_init(director)
        product = self.real_client.create_product(director, mvp)
        print(self.logger.log(self.real_client.sender, self.real_client.recipient))

        return product
```

#### Facade
```
class ClientProcessor:
    def __init__(self, sender, recipient):
        self.sender = sender
        self.recipient = recipient

    @staticmethod
    def create_product(director, mvp=False):
        if not mvp:
            product = director.create_full_product()
        else:
            product = director.create_minimal_product()
        return product
```
